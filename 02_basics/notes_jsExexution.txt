 Javascript execution Context
 {} => global execution Context , in previous we discussed using "this"
 TO note :
 Js is a single threaded , everything is a process 
 
 2: context
 Global execution context 
 Function execution context 
 Eval execution context (this a property , its fine to just say the above two for an interview)

 {} :-> runs in two phase 
 1) Memory creation phase //allocation of memory 
 2) Execution phase       // stuff like arithmatic operation is done here
 
 EX :
 say 
 let val1 = 10 
 let val2 = 5
 function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total = num1+num2
    return total
 }
 let result1 = addNum(val1,val2)
 let result2 = addNum(5,3)

 ------------ HOW WILL THIS CODE EXECUTE--------------

 1-> Global Execution
 -"this" stores GE 
 2-> Memory Phase (the steps in which the above is stored )
 val1 -> undefined
 val2 -> undefined 
 addNum -> defination of the function 
 result1 -> undefined
 result2 -> undefined // This is first cycle 

 3-> Execution Phase 
 val1 -> 10
 val2 -> 5 
 // addnum will execute nothing as this is an execution phase so addnum will not do anything
 // thos addnum will make its own context box called new exectional context
 which will contain new variable environment + exection thread 
 every time a function is called a new executional context will be created ;
 when a sandbox(executional context) the memory and execution phase will be repeated again
 So,
 Memory Phase ->
 val1 -> undefined
 val2 -> undefined 
 total -> undefined 
 
 Execution context ->
 processing is done , data manupalating etc is done 
 num1 -> 10 
 num2 -> 5
 Note : after GE is used it automatically gets deleted as well 
 total -> 15 
 
 now  it goes back to the previous memory phase
 and does 
 result = 15 
 now same stuff with resulttwo  new variable environment and a thread with its two phase 


 ---------------------- CALL STACK----------------------------


 Global execution is the first in the stack 
 LIFO is used
 to know in depth and visualization then got this video for a hindi speaker : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByhtOgF6uYM&list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37&index=25&t=105s

 The concept will be better understood with help of visualization . So check them out
