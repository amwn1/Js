"use strict" // treats all the JS code as the newer version

// alert(3+3) // won't work as we using node.js and not browser

// console.log(3+3) console.log("Aman")  this wont work you need to use the semicolon between them , though the code readablity is the worst ; So avoid the practice\

// console.log(3+3)  
// console.log("Aman") // this is the way 

let name = "Aman";
let age = 20;
let isLoggedin = false 

// let can be used like this 
// there is a differnece between null and undefined , if a value is null then it is not undefined but empty , vice verca;
// symbol is also a data type mostly used for uniqueness 

// OBJECT 

console.log(typeof null); // the output results to "object"\
console.log(typeof undefined); // the output results to "undefined"
